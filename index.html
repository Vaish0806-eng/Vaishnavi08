    <p> <h3>
      Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players on a field, at the centre of which is a 22-yard (20-metre;
       66-foot) pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails (small sticks) balanced on three stumps. 
       Two players from the batting team, the striker and nonstriker, stand in front of either wicket holding bats,
        while one player from the fielding team, the bowler, bowls the ball toward the striker's wicket from the opposite end of the pitch.

      <br><h2>Formats</h2>
   <p><h3>The 21st century brought with it the Bangladesh Team, who made their Test debut in 2000.
     The game itself also grew, with a new format made up of 20-over innings being created. 
     This format, called T20 cricket, quickly became a highly popular format, putting the longer formats at risk.
      The new shorter format also introduced franchise cricket, with new tournaments like the Indian Premier League
       and the Australian Big Bash League. The ICC has selected the T20 format as cricket's growth format, and has
        introduced a T20 World Cup which is played every two years;

<h2><b>Importance</b></h2>
<h3>The ball is a hard leather-seamed spheroid, with a circumference of 9 inches (23 cm).]
   The ball has a "seam": six rows of stitches attaching the leather shell of the ball to the string and cork interior. 
   The seam on a new ball is prominent and helps the bowler propel it in a less predictable manner.
    During matches, the quality of the ball deteriorates to a point where it is no longer usable; during the course of this deterioration,
     its behaviour in flight will change and can influence the outcome of the match. Players will, therefore, attempt to modify the ball's 
     behaviour by modifying its physical properties. Polishing the ball and wetting it with sweat or saliva was legal, even when
      the polishing was deliberately done on one side only to increase the ball's swing through the air.
